Welcome to the home of Srcery's projects.  Under this organization we've
tried to collect all official or affiliated projects.

## Introduction

Srcery  is a color scheme with clearly defined contrasting colors and a
slightly earthy tone.

Created using colors that logically adheres to the 16 color base palette
of a given terminal, while trying to retain its own identity. The colors
are designed to be easy on the eyes yet contrast well with the
background for long sessions using an editor or terminal emulator.
